This Jupyter notebook is created to import a pre-existing network model inside PandaPower, present information about the network model, and finally run a power flow showing the numerical results.
This notebook uses the case9.json.

The Pandapower networks module contains example networks, simple test networks, randomly generated networks, CIGRE test networks, IEEE case files and synthetic low voltage networks from Georg Kerber and Lindner et al. and Dickert et al.

This example uses the json file **case9.json**, whose data origin is PYPOWER. 
**NOTE: PandaPower website claims this network was published in Anderson and Fouad’s book ‘Power System Control and Stability’ for the first time in 1980.
However, this is a modified version of the original network.**
